# Simple_React_Slider
(trining on react js) this is the source code of react Slider

this is a simple slider that may contain images or other components

it is very simple and based on a tutorial (https://medium.com/@ItsMeDannyZ/build-an-image-slider-with-react-es6-264368de68e4)
I followed the tutorial and then changed a few things like adding support for a component, not just images, also added caption component.
